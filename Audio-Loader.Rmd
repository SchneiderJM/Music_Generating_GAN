# Audio Loader

The purposes of this notebook is to test audio loading and playback with pyaudio and Librosa.

I am testing this on a local copy of Joji's album Ballads 1 that I converted to WAV files. For copyright reasons, these files are listed in the .gitignore file and are not uploaded.

```{python}
import librosa 
import os
#The path to the audio files
path = os.getcwd()+'\\Joji\\'

#Loads in the first track as a test
#x is the audio, sr is the sampling rate
x,sr = librosa.load(path+'01 ATTENTION.mp3.wav')

print(type(x),type(sr))
```

## Playback

This cell uses IPython to playback the loaded track

```{python}
import IPython.display as ipd

#ipd.Audio(path+'01 ATTENTION.wav')
ipd.Audio(x,rate=sr)
```

## Visualization

Visualizing the waveform

```{python}
# %matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import librosa.display

plt.figure(figsize=(14, 5))
librosa.display.waveplot(x, sr=sr)

```

## Testing Audio Generation 

This is just some white noise

```{python}
import numpy as np

testaudio = np.random.rand(1,500000)
ipd.Audio(testaudio,rate=sr)
```

This is a flat tone (WARNING high pitched and loud)

```{python}
testaudio = np.tile([0,0.000005,0.00001],100000)
ipd.Audio(testaudio,rate=sr)
```

```{python}
#Sets it backwards
ipd.Audio(np.flip(x),rate=sr)
```

```{python}
#adds a tiny bit of random noise
testaudio = x + np.random.normal(-0.01,0.01,[1,len(x)])
ipd.Audio(testaudio,rate=sr)
```
